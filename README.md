This project is a rapid screening model for identifying coastal US counties with vulnerable bridges. It uses the following data:
* FHWA National Bridge Inventory
* US Census County Population Data
* NCEI Storm Events Database Data

The python notebook (*.ipynb) is a wrapper that will create the necessary output directories and call the remaining python scripts in the order they should be run.
